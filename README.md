# modInverse

Write a code that calculates the Modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm?

Multiplicative inverse
When we use multiplication (×) as operation (e.g. 2×3), then the inverse of a number (relative to multiplication) is called the multiplicative inverse.
In Zn, two numbers a and b are multiplicative inverses of each other if:
a × b ≡ 1 (mod n).
NB: not each integer has a multiplicative inverse! Only if gcd(that integer, n) == 1

x and y

where:
      xa + yb = (x, y)
